# Welcome to project MdSharp

### The focus of this project is to wrap MelissaÂ® API Cloud Services and to demonstrate the implementation of this library into a Blazor Server Project as well as a Console Application using "Microsoft.Hosting".

### This is not going to be a production demo because it will not include any ui cleansing nor traffic handling services or further middlewares. In my scenario, Polly will handle as a registered service Http Exceptions.

### It is dedicated to my own educational benefit and for other developers who are considering to implement a Web Service for Address Validation and those who like to build a prototype in about 5 lines of code.

### Parts of the documentation from MelissaWiki will be reflected in summaries to provide a smooth coding.
