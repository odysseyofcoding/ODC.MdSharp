# Welcome to project MdSharp

### The focus of this project is to wrap Melissa® API Cloud Services and to demonstrate the implementation of this library into a .NET7 Blazor Server Project as well as a Console Application using "Microsoft.Hosting".

### This is not going to be a production demo because it will not include any ui cleansing nor traffic handling services or further middlewares. In my scenario, Polly will handle as a registered service Http Exceptions.

### It is dedicated to my own educational benefit and for other developers who are considering to implement a Web Service for Address Validation and those who like to build a prototype in about 5 lines of code.

### Parts of the documentation from MelissaWiki® will be reflected in summaries to provide a smooth coding.

### Feel free to copy the code and to build your own version out of it.

### I will probably refactor the code. For example, I am considering using Interfaces instead of Generics and some other little things that could be a better practice.

### If you have any questions, contact me via the contact owner button at https://www.nuget.org/packages/Xdroid.MyFirstNuget
